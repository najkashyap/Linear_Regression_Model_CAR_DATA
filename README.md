# Linear_Regression_Model_CAR_DATA
I build a linear regression model for predicting the "Mileage per gallon" of different brands of car. In this project I first build the model using hand coding without using scikit libraries. And in second part of code I build the model using scikit-learn libraries. Thenafter I compare the performance of model in both the cases.
